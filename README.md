## 📌 Overview

India's rural communities face challenges such as market inaccessibility, lack of crop insights, delayed infrastructure repair, and limited awareness of government support schemes. **Rural Connect** bridges these gaps by offering a unified platform for:

- 🌦️ Real-time weather forecasts & market prices
- 💬 Direct trade between farmers and buyers (no middlemen)
- 🗳️ Civic issue reporting with voting & admin resolution
- 🧑‍🌾 Job listings and rural employment opportunities
- 📢 Verified government schemes & microfinance info
- ☎️ IVRS integration for users without smartphones

This project aims to revolutionize rural development through decentralization, transparency, and accessibility.
